  abstract  = {Providing efficient transport services over multi-hop ad hoc networks is a fundamental building block for this wireless technology. The typical approach is modifying transmission control protocol (TCP) to fix one (or a few of) its inefficiency while preserving compatibility with the original protocol. However, a complete solution should include a significant number of modifications, such that the original TCP design is deeply modified. In this paper we explore a different approach. We include the desired modifications to TCP in the design of a new transport protocol [transport protocol for ad-hoc (TPA)]. In this way we are able to blend together these features in a unique design framework, and better control interactions among the different (modified) components. We then compare TCP and TPA through field tests, in terms of throughput and total number of transmitted segments. We consider several possible configurations of the protocol parameters, different routing protocols and various networking scenarios. In all the cases taken into consideration, TPA significantly outperforms TCP. To achieve a more thorough understanding of the TPA behaviour, we compare TPA and TCP also in terms of fairness and scalability (both in static and mobile configurations) over a wide range of representative topologies. To this end, we adopt a simulation approach, which is more suitable to this kind of analysis. Simulation results confirm field tests, and show that TPA is able to outperform TCP with respect to all analysed performance figures.},

  abstract  = {Road traffic information helps a driver in selecting an appropriate route to the travel destination by avoiding congested road segments. A vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) offers an alternative approach to collect road traffic information without a wired infrastructure and centralized storage. This paper proposes the road traffic collecting (RTC) protocol to gather road traffic information in a VANET on city roads. The key protocol operation is the query dissemination that steers a query message over a set of predefined routes towards the destination location. To collect road traffic information, nodes participating in the query dissemination include their own velocity to the query message so that congestion information on different positions of road segments is gathered. A node nearest to the destination that receives the query message returns the query reply containing road traffic information of the forward route back to the source. Unlike existing broadcasting and geocasting protocols, our proposed protocol uses the message exchange pattern that increases the reliability of query delivery under a collision channel. The simulation on a large network with high vehicle densities and simultaneous query sessions is conducted to evaluate the protocol performance in terms of the percentage of road segment coverage and the query response time under the presence of MAC layer collisions. The results show that RTC can collect 100 % of road traffic information over a set of predefined routes under a few number of parallel query sessions while an existing protocol that mainly uses a broadcast message can achieve only 40–70 %. For a large number of query sessions, RTC achieves 65–80 % of target road segments depending on the vehicle density with the average query time bounded to a few seconds.},

  abstract  = {<p>As the Mobile Ad Hoc Networks technologies face a series of challenges like dynamic changes of topological structure, existence of unidirectional channel, limited wireless transmission bandwidth, the capability limitations of mobile termination and etc, therefore, the research to mobile Ad Hoc network routings inevitablely undertake a more important task than those to other networks. Multicast is a mode of communication transmission oriented to group computing, which sends the data to a group of host computers by using single source address. In a typical mobile Ad Hoc Network environment, multicast has a significant meaning. On the one hand, the users of mobile Ad Hoc Network usually need to form collaborative working groups; on the other hand, this is also an important means of fully using the broadcast performances of wireless communication and effectively using the limited wireless channel resources. This paper summarizes and comparatively analyzes the routing mechanisms of...},
